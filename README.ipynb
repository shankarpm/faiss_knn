    "\n",
    "Faiss is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It contains algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size, up to ones that possibly do not fit in RAM. It also contains supporting code for evaluation and parameter tuning. Faiss is written in C++ with complete wrappers for Python/numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "This KNN Component is developed with Wrapper using FAISS Python library and uses this [python wrapper API](https://github.com/shankarpm/faiss_knn/blob/master/faiss_knn.py) to train and predict models using FAISS Library. This FAISS Implementation can work in CPU and GPU Instances.\n",

Ran the code again with the same parameters , it took almost 18 seconds to train the model.Its almost 4 times faster on the 2nd time.       "
